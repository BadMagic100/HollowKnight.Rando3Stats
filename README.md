# Rando3Stats
Rando3Stats is a Hollow Knight mod used with Randomizer mod. It provides detailed statistics about your obtained checks on the completion screen after the credits,
and changes that screen's behavior from "press any button" to "hold any button" to prevent accidentally skipping it.

This mod is *tested* to be compatible with the following:
* Randomizer 3.13(288) - this is the current Randomizer version. If you're not using it... why?
* Randomizer ItemSync 1.3.0

These are the latest and greatest dependencies. I strongly recommend you use them if able.

This mod *may work* with the following, but I don't make any guarantees:
* Randomizer v3.12c(884)
* Randomizer v3.12(573)
* Randomizer Multiworld 0.1.1

The older randomizer versions seem to generally be compatible with 3.13. If for some reason you are dead-set on not upgrading to the new version, give it a try and let me
know whether it works so I can update this readme. This mod is not yet tested with Multiworld. Using it with Multiworld (probably) won't crash your game or anything, but you will 
likely run into some unexpected behaviors and/or failed stat calculations.
